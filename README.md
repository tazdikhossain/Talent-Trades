Project Description: E-commerce Platform
In this project, I participated as a buyer (user) on a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to offer a seamless and engaging shopping experience. The platform was built using a combination of modern front-end and back-end technologies to ensure high performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Frontend:

ReactJS: Leveraged for building interactive user interfaces and dynamic components, ensuring a responsive and fluid user experience.
NextJS: Utilized for server-side rendering and static site generation, which improved page load times and SEO performance.
Axios: Employed for making API requests, facilitating smooth communication between the front-end and back-end services.
TailwindCSS: Adopted for styling the application, providing a consistent and visually appealing design with minimal effort.
Backend:

NestJS: Used as the framework for building the server-side application, providing a robust and scalable architecture.
TypeScript: Ensured type safety and improved code maintainability throughout the project.
JavaScript: Utilized alongside TypeScript to enhance flexibility in coding practices.
PostgreSQL: Selected as the database for its reliability and advanced features, ensuring secure and efficient data storage.
TypeORM: Implemented for object-relational mapping, simplifying database interactions and query management.
As a buyer, my experience on the platform included features such as product browsing, detailed product pages, secure checkout processes, and personalized recommendations. The combination of these technologies resulted in a highly efficient and user-friendly e-commerce solution that catered to the needs of modern online shoppers.
